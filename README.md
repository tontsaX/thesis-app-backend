# Thesis: Ridesharing REST API With Spring Boot

[![CircleCI](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/tontsaX/thesis-ridesharing-rest-api-with-spring-boot.svg?style=shield)](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/tontsaX/thesis-ridesharing-rest-api-with-spring-boot)

This project is a REST API for an imagenary ridesharing application and it is the practice part of my thesis. 
<br>
<br>
The original idea was to create a REST service and a mobile app as my thesis, but the thesis goal is changed to contain only the REST service.
I came in the conclusion that programming a REST API and writing about the process, tests, useage and science behind the service can be tied easier together
than trying to write about two separate applications.
<br>
<br>
I'll write entirely separate demo application, that uses API made in this project, later.
